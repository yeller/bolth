# bolth

## TODO: picture of usain bolt

A Clojure library that provides a better test runner for `clojure.test`. Humane
failure output (with pprinted data diffs), humane exception stacktraces, colorized test
results, and a variety of reporting options.

## Usage

There's one main function: `bolth/run-all-tests`.

`run-all-tests` mirrors the interface of `clojure.test/run-all-tests`: it takes
a regex to specify which tests to run. However, it also takes an option map with a whole load
of options.

Here's what it looks like in typical usage with a bunch of the options enabled:

## TODOs: gifs

## TODO: passing run

## TODO: failing run with diffs

## TODO: passing run with slow tests reported

There's also an helper function that uses `io.aviso.exception/write-exception`
to call clojure.tools.namespace.repl/refresh and pretty print the exception
from that if there is one. See the example `script/test` for sample usage with
grenchman.
